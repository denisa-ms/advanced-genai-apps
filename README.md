* GenAI completion quality
* Risk mitigation for GenAI apps: red team, risk assessment 
* Testing and Automation for GenAI apps	 

## GenAI development challenges
* Accuracy
    * Chunking strategy
    * Consider editing content format for document processing efficiency
* Cost
    * Chunk and storage optimization
    * Cheaper/ Faster model
    * Latency
    * Faster model 
    * Use PTUs
* Monitor and iterate

## GenAI development stages
* Identify
    * Use cases
    * Requirements 
    * Infrastructure
* Pre evaluate 
    * Chunking strategy 
    * Embedding models
    * Vector DB
    * LLM models
    * Evaluate prompts
* Development
    * [Use prompty](https://github.com/denisa-ms/advanced-genai-apps/tree/main/5-E2E)
    * [Generate testing data](https://github.com/denisa-ms/advanced-genai-apps/tree/main/1-Preparation)
* Optimization
    * [Use reranking or subqueries](https://github.com/denisa-ms/advanced-genai-apps/tree/main/2-Optimization)
* Deployment
    * [Testing - use evaluators for completion Quality and safety](https://github.com/denisa-ms/advanced-genai-apps/tree/main/3-Completion%20Quality%20and%20Safety)
* [Create a RAG with AI search](https://github.com/denisa-ms/advanced-genai-apps/tree/main/6-Rag%20with%20AI%20search)
